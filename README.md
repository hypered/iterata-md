# Lex Iterata - Markdown files

[Lex Iterata](https://refli.be/fr/lex) is a project to collect and transform
the content of the Belgian Official Journal web site. It presents that content
in an enhanced format for human comprehension, while also providing structured
data tailored for machine consumption. In this Git repository, the same content
is presented as a collection of files written using the Markdown format.

The specific Markdown markup elements chosen to represent the structural
features of the legislative texts are loosely modeled on the choices made by
`OpenJustice.be` in [their work](https://github.com/openjusticebe/be_laws_fr).
For instance a Chapter is a level-3 heading, and an Article is represented in
**bold**.

## Content

The repository contains texts obtained from the Belgian Official Journal web
site, more specifically from Justel (the consolidated texts). Currently we only
generate the French version of the texts.

[Here is a link to one example
text](https://github.com/hypered/iterata-md/blob/main/texts/2016/00/2016000032.md).
You can use the "Go to file" button visible in the GitHub interface to navigate
to a specific document using its document number (e.g. 2016000032 in the
previous example).

This repository contains 201609 legislative texts.
