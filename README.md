# Lex Iterata - Markdown files

[Lex Iterata](https://refli.be/fr/lex) is a project to collect and transform
the content of the Belgian Official Journal web site. It presents that content
in an enhanced format for human comprehension, while also providing structured
data tailored for machine consumption. In this Git repository, the same content
is presented as a collection of files written using the Markdown format.

The specific Markdown markup elements chosen to represent the structural
features of the legislative texts are loosely modeled on the choices made by
`OpenJustice.be` in [their work](https://github.com/openjusticebe/be_laws_fr).
For instance a Chapter is a level-3 heading, and an Article is represented in
**bold**.
